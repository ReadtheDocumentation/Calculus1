Professor Rogness,
Here are a two videos of the error I wrote about above. One of the videos shows a successful upload, and the other one has the error that occured during my upload. I thought about what you said, that the score I receive willl not affect my overall letter grade, but I cannot rest knowning that I got 55 on my exam score. Even though I would still get an A minus, I am asking once again if you could put my actual grade in Canvas. With that being said, the two videos are attached via Google Drive in the email.
Sincerely,
Keerthik Muruganandam
